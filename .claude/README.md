## 🎯 What Goes Where

### `.claude/` - Workflow Instructions (5 files)
**Purpose:** Tell Claude HOW to work

**Contains:**
- ✅ README.md - This documentation
- ✅ instructions.md - Workflow rules, coding standards
- ✅ wireframe-rules.md - Layout vs styling rules
- ✅ tasks/task-template.md - Blueprint for new tasks
- ✅ tasks/current-task.md - Active task tracking

**Claude reads these files every time it works!**

---

### `business-context/` - For Claude.ai Project Only
**Purpose:** Business knowledge for SRS generation

**Contains:**
- Company information
- Target audience details
- Brand guidelines
- Technical constraints
- SRS template structure

**Used by:** Claude.ai Project to generate professional SRS documents

**NOT used by:** Claude Code (it reads the generated SRS, not this)

---

### `requirements/` - Generated SRS Documents
**Purpose:** What to build

**Contains:**
- SRS documents generated by Claude.ai Project
- Versioned (v1.0, v1.1, FINAL)
- Structured requirements with FR-XXX codes
- Acceptance criteria

**Used by:** Claude Code reads these to understand what to build

---

### `wireframes/` - Design Files
**Purpose:** How it should look (structure only)

**Contains:**
- HTML wireframes (one per page/feature)
- Can organize by feature, device, or flat structure

**Used by:** Claude Code extracts LAYOUT only (not styling)

---

### `src/` - Your Code
**Purpose:** What Claude Code builds

**Contains:**
- All your application code
- Components, pages, utilities, types
- Tests

**Modified by:** Claude Code creates and edits files here

---

## 🚀 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Generate SRS (Claude.ai Project)
```
Input: Your temp requirements + business context
Tool: Claude.ai Project (has business-context/ files)
Output: requirements/SRS-feature-FINAL.md
```

### Step 2: Create Wireframes (You or Claude.ai)
```
Input: SRS requirements + brand guidelines
Tool: Figma, Claude.ai, or design tool
Output: wireframes/*.html files
```

### Step 3: Build Features (Claude Code)
```
Input: requirements/SRS-feature-FINAL.md + wireframes/*.html
Tool: Claude Code (reads .claude/ instructions)
Output: Working code in src/
```

---

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### Initial Setup (One Time)

1. **Copy `.claude/` folder to your project root**
   ```bash
   your-project/
   └── .claude/        ← Drop this entire folder here
   ```

2. **Create other folders as needed**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p business-context requirements wireframes
   ```

3. **Add your business context** (for Claude.ai Project)
   ```bash
   # Create files in business-context/
   - company-overview.md
   - brand-guidelines.md
   - etc.
   ```

---

### Starting a New Feature

#### Option A: With Existing SRS

```
You: "I have an SRS and wireframes for hotel search.
      
      Requirements: requirements/SRS-hotel-search-FINAL.md
      Wireframes: wireframes/01-search.html, wireframes/02-results.html
      
      Read the SRS and break it into features."

Claude Code: [Analyzes, proposes feature breakdown]

You: "Start with Feature 1: Core Search"

Claude Code: [Creates task, begins Phase 1]
```

#### Option B: Generate SRS First

**In Claude.ai Project:**
```
You: "Generate an SRS for hotel search feature.
      [Describe requirements]
      Use our business context and template."

Claude.ai: [Generates SRS]

You: "Save as requirements/SRS-hotel-search-v1.0.md"
```

**Then in Claude Code:**
```
You: "Build Feature 1 from requirements/SRS-hotel-search-v1.0.md"
```

---

### Development Commands

```bash
# Check status
"What's the current status?"
"Show me progress"

# Approve phases
"Phase 1 approved, start Phase 2"
"Continue to next phase"

# Make changes
"Add authentication requirement"
"Use a different component library"

# Complete and move on
"Archive this task and start Feature 2"
```

---

## 🎯 Key Guarantees

### Claude Code ALWAYS Reads (Every Time):
1. ✅ `.claude/instructions.md` - Your coding standards
2. ✅ `.claude/tasks/current-task.md` - Current progress
3. ✅ `.claude/wireframe-rules.md` - When working with designs

### This Guarantees:
- ✅ Consistent coding style
- ✅ Follows your naming conventions
- ✅ Uses correct component patterns
- ✅ Extracts layout only from wireframes (not styling)
- ✅ Stops at phase boundaries for approval
- ✅ Updates task tracking religiously

---

## 📝 The 4-Phase Workflow

Every feature goes through 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Planning
- Breaks down requirements
- Identifies components
- Plans data structures
- Maps acceptance criteria
- **STOPS for approval**

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Writes code
- Creates components
- Updates progress in real-time
- **STOPS for approval**

### Phase 3: Testing & Review
- Tests all scenarios
- Checks responsive design
- Verifies acceptance criteria
- **STOPS for approval**

### Phase 4: Reflection
- Documents learnings
- Identifies technical debt
- Suggests improvements
- **Archives task**

---

## 🎨 Wireframe Rules Summary

**Claude extracts from wireframes:**
- ✅ Layout structure (grid, flex, positioning)
- ✅ Component placement
- ✅ Spacing and gaps
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints

**Claude ignores from wireframes:**
- ❌ Colors
- ❌ Button styles
- ❌ Typography
- ❌ Custom CSS
- ❌ Any visual styling

**Instead uses:**
- ✅ ShadCN components with default styling

## 📚 File Purposes

| File | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `README.md` | System documentation | You read this |
| `instructions.md` | Main workflow rules | Claude reads every time |
| `wireframe-rules.md` | Design implementation rules | Claude reads when designing |
| `task-template.md` | Blueprint for tasks | Copy to start new task |
| `current-task.md` | Active task tracking | Claude updates constantly |
| `completed/*.md` | Finished tasks | Reference for future |

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Add Your Coding Standards

Edit `.claude/instructions.md`:

```markdown
## Project-Specific Standards

### Our Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS + ShadCN
- React Query for data fetching

### Our Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase
- Hooks: use + PascalCase (useAuth)
- Utils: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### Our Error Handling
- Always use try-catch for async
- Toast notifications for user errors
- Console.error for debug info

### Our Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all utilities
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical flows
```

**Claude will follow these rules every time!**

---

### Add Your Style Preferences

Edit `.claude/instructions.md`:

```markdown
## Communication Preferences

### Code Comments
- Use JSDoc for public functions
- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Comment complex algorithms only

### Component Structure
- One component per file
- Props interface above component
- Named exports (not default)

### Import Order
1. React imports
2. Third-party libraries
3. Internal components
4. Types
5. Styles
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Claude isn't following your rules
```
You: "Before continuing, read .claude/instructions.md and 
      .claude/wireframe-rules.md"
```

### Claude skipped a phase
```
You: "Stop. You need to complete Phase 2 reflection 
      before moving to Phase 3"
```

### Task file not updating
```
You: "Update current-task.md with your progress"
```

### Claude used wireframe styling
```
You: "This is wrong. Read .claude/wireframe-rules.md.
      You should use ShadCN components, not wireframe colors.
      Rebuild using layout only."
```

---
